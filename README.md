This repository contains the deliverables for a group project completed by BIT students at the **FHNW University of Applied Sciences and Arts Northwestern Switzerland**.
The project focuses on BI and data analytics solution using a real-world customer feedback dataset ([Customer Sentiment Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kundanbedmutha/customer-sentiment-dataset))The primary goal was to apply data science and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to extract actionable business insights.

## Project Overview
Our objective was to move beyond simple positive/negative sentiment metrics and identify the root causes or themes driving customer satisfaction and dissatisfaction across various product categories and platforms.
The solution demonstrates a full data science pipeline: data ingestion, text preprocessing, unsupervised machine learning (Topic Modeling via NMF or LDA), and the integration of unstructured text insights with structured operational data to answer critical stakeholder questions within an organization.
